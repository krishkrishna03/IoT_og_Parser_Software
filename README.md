# IoT Log Parser

## Introduction
At Smart City Living Lab, we work across hardware, software, and their intersection. A core requirement for a smart city is a platform that collects data from diverse hardware devices and sensors, making it accessible for analysis and visualization. This project aims to build a robust IoT log parser that efficiently extracts, structures, and visualizes log data from various sensors and devices.

## Problem Statement
The task is to build an IoT log parser that:
1. Extracts key-value pairs from log entries.
2. Structures the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Decodes Base64 encoded images embedded in the logs.
4. Visualizes the parsed data using charts and graphs.
5. Handles errors gracefully and provides informative error messages.
6. If web server logs are provided, parses metrics such as request counts, response codes, and access times.

The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard to display the processed data in a visually appealing and informative manner.

## Specifications

### 1. Data Extraction and Structuring
The parser is designed to:
- **Extract data** from the log file accurately, handling different data types (strings, integers, floats, Booleans), and manage missing values (`null`) gracefully.
- **Structure the data** into a Pandas DataFrame for easy access and further analysis.
- **Decode Base64 images** embedded within the log files.
- **Parse web server logs** (Apache/Nginx) to extract metrics like request counts, response codes, and access times.

### 2. Data Visualization
Visualizations will be generated using the following types of charts:
- **Logs Over Time**: Line chart showing log count by hour.
- **Top 5 Events**: Pie chart displaying the most frequent log events.
- **Log Activity Heatmap**: Heatmap showing activity distribution by hour.
- **Top 10 Users**: Bar chart displaying the top 10 users by log count.
- **Cumulative Log Trend**: Line chart showing cumulative log counts over time.
- **Log Distribution by Weekday**: Bar chart showing the distribution of logs by weekday.
- **Average Log Message Length by Hour**: Line chart displaying average log message length over different hours.
- **Log Message Length vs Hour**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between log message length and hour.
- **Action Type Distribution**: Pie chart showing the distribution of log actions (e.g., login, logout).
- **Log Message Length Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of log message lengths.

### 3. Error Handling
- **Graceful error handling**: The parser will handle unexpected formats and invalid log entries without crashing, providing meaningful error messages.
- **Informative error messages**: If an error occurs, a clear message with the error type and log entry location will be outputted.

## Installation Instructions/Setup

To set up and run the IoT log parser, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iot-log-parser.git
cd iot-log-parser
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies:
This project uses Python 3.x and requires the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- flask

You can install all dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Log File:
Make sure you have a log file (`logs.txt`) in the project directory, which contains the data to be parsed. If the log file includes Base64 encoded images, they will be decoded and saved in the `static/images` folder.

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Flask web application:
To run the application and access the dashboard, execute the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 2. Access the Dashboard:
Once the application is running, open a web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
The dashboard will display various charts visualizing the parsed log data.

## Screenshots

Below are some example screenshots of the dashboard:

- **Top 5 Events (Pie Chart)**:

- **Action Type Distribution (Pie Chart)**:

## Assumptions

- The log file (`logs.txt`) contains a mix of text logs, Base64 encoded images, and possibly web server logs.
- The data is structured with key-value pairs, and logs are consistently formatted.
- Base64 encoded images, if present, will be decoded and saved in the `static/images` folder.
- If web server logs are provided, they will follow a standard Apache/Nginx log format.

## Bonus: Performance Analysis

The performance of the parser is evaluated by measuring the time it takes to process logs of different sizes. The following metrics are used:
- **Processing time for different log file sizes**: How long it takes to parse logs of varying sizes (e.g., 1 MB, 10 MB, 50 MB).
- **Time taken from data ingestion to visualization**: The time it takes from loading the log file to generating the visualizations.

## Additional Points
- This parser was developed using **Python 3.x**. Other programming languages may be used, but Python is recommended for compatibility with the tools used at Smart City Living Lab.
- **AI Tools**: No AI tools were used during the development of this project.
